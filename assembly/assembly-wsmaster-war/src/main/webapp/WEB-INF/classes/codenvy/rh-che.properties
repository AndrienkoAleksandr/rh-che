# This is a routing suffix that can be used when building workspace agents external address
# with a custom server evaluation strategy. This is similar to the che.docker.ip.external
# property, but specific to the workspaces. So this is mainly useful when workspaces are not
# hosted on the same machine as the main Che server and workspace master.
# This is used as the default value if no other value is provided by the
# `com.redhat.che.multitenant.Fabric8WorkspaceEnvironmentProvider.getUserCheTenantData()`
# method.

# Specifies if the fabric8 multi-tenant mode is used
